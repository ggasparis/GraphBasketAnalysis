# Graph Analysis on NBA data

This project is about reasoning in NBA [games data](https://www.kaggle.com/nathanlauga/nba-games). 

### Objective
Goal of this project: 
* Create powerful graph and descriptive metadata 
* Î—ighlight "hidden" data
* Reinforce the prediction and the decision making

Description of the [datasets](https://github.com/ggasparis/GraphBasketAnalysis/tree/main/Data):
*  players.csv: Players details with their names.
*  games.csv: all the games with the date, teams and some game details
*  games_details.csv: all the games with game details of every player
*  teams.csv: all the nba teams 
*  ranking.csv: the rankings of the teams till specific date

### Data Analysis
The analysis that aims to describe the data in more detail. 
* R
* RStudio

### Data Visualization
For better understanding the data, it need to be visualized. 
* Tableau 
* RStudio 

### Graph Analysis
The data has been imported in [neo4j](https://neo4j.com) local enviroment. With the graph database, it's possible to create multiple nodes and relatioships through the data, so it can be queried in detail.

### Graph Algorithms
Finally some similarity algorithms are applied in the data for strengthening the metadata that are produced.
